# Git and GitHub in R/RStudio

This short workshop (and repo) provide information on the following things:

* An introduction to Git and GitHub
* An introduction to connecting GitHub to R/RStudio
* Some of the benefits and workflow details of using GitHub to collaborate

This workshop assumes that you have:

* Installed R ([need help?](https://www.r-project.org/)) and RStudio ([need help?](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))
* Installed Git ([need help?](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html))
* Created an account on GitHub ([need help?](https://github.com/))

OPTIONALLY, you may

* Install GitHub Desktop ([need help?](https://desktop.github.com/))

A great deal of the content is taken or adapted from Jenny Bryan's outstanding site "Happy Git With R" ([Happy Git With R](https://happygitwithr.com/)), which I can't recommend enough.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email me at hglanz@calpoly.edu.
